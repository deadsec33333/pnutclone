Cats add a special presence to a home, and the relationship that forms over the years between a cat owner and his or her cat is unique. We know this from firsthand experience\u2014many of us are cat owners ourselves. ViaGen is the word leader in animal cloning and reproductive technology. Over the past 15 years, we\u2019ve invested significantly to advance the <a href=\"https:\/\/viagenpets.com\/product\/genetic-preservation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">groundbreaking technology<\/a> behind these processes. We\u2019ve successfully cloned thousands of cows and hundreds of horses, delivering healthy, happy animals to our long-time clients. Our parent company, TransOva Genetics, has been providing leading animal cloning and reproductive services for livestock clients for over thirty years. Our commitment to exacting science and animal welfare is unmatched in the space. We are excited to now add cat cloning to our services through ViaGen Pets, using the same successful, patented processes we\u2019ve developed over decades of work.<\/p>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: left;\">What Is a cloned cat?<\/h1>\n<p>We know that many cat owners have questions about cat cloning. A cloned cat is simply a genetic twin of your current cat, born at a later date in time. Cat cloning does not change the genetic make-up of your cat and does not involve any genetic modification. Your cloned cat will share many of the most important attributes of your current cat, including appearance, intelligence and temperament. Your cloned cat will be just as healthy and live just as long as your current cat, and is no more susceptible to health issues than any other cat. If you are interested in cat cloning, the first step you should take is to preserve your cat\u2019s genes through genetic preservation (GP). Your veterinarian will collect a small tissue sample, in a quick and simple biopsy procedure. That tissue sample will then be sent to ViaGen Pets, where we will culture new cells that share the <a href=\"https:\/\/viagenpets.com\/dog-cloning\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">same genetic identity<\/a> as the tissue sample. We will then freeze these cultured cells and they can be stored safely for many years, if desired. Many cat owners from across the United States have already preserved their cats\u2019 genetic identities with ViaGen Pets.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cat Cloning Presents A Unique Opportunity Cat cloning by ViaGen Pets allows cat owners to extend the opportunity for the unique happiness and companionship that a beloved cat brings.
