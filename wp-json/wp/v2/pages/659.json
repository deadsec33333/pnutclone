Dogs provide a unique form of companionship, loyalty and love. It is difficult for many dog owners to imagine life without their dog. Indeed, many dogs become a <a href=\"https:\/\/viagenpets.com\/cat-cloning\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">member of the family<\/a>. At ViaGen Pets, many of us are loving dog owners ourselves and we understand intimately the nature of these relationships. ViaGen is a world leader in animal cloning. Our scientists have been developing successful animal cloning and reproductive technology for over 15 years. Our parent company, TransOva Genetics, was started by a small group of veterinary scientists and has been developing the science behind these practices for over 30 years. We have produced thousands of happy, healthy cloned cows and hundreds of cloned horses, among other animals. The same practices and expertise that underlie these successes are now being brought to dog cloning through ViaGen Pets. Our vision at ViaGen Pets is to continue to develop and grow the science so that dog cloning is <a href=\"https:\/\/viagenpets.com\/cost-to-clone-pet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">available to all<\/a> dog owners.<\/p>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: left;\">Clone your Dog<\/h1>\n<p>We know that many dog owners have questions about cloning dogs. A cloned dog is simply a genetic twin of your dog, born at a later date. The cloned twin will share many of the <a href=\"https:\/\/viagenpets.com\/product\/genetic-preservation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">key attributes<\/a> of your current dog, often including intelligence, temperament and appearance. The genetic identity of cloned dogs is identical to the original dogs. Dog cloning does not involve any changes to the genes of your dog. Cloned dogs live full, healthy and happy lives and are no more susceptible to health problems than any other dogs. The first step in having the option to clone your dog is to preserve your dog\u2019s genes through genetic preservation (GP). Your veterinarian will collect a small tissue sample from your dog. This process is a minor procedure. That tissue sample will then be mailed to ViaGen Pets, where we will culture new cells that share the same genetic make-up. We will then freeze these cells until you\u2019re ready to clone your dog.<\/p>\n<p>Need more information, don&#8217;t hesitate to contact us at\u00a0888-876-6104 and speak with one of our experts today.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dog Cloning in the\u00a0U.S. Dog cloning through ViaGen Pets presents an opportunity for dog owners to open a new window for extending their relationships with their beloved pets.
