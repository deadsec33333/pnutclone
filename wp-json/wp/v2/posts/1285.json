With our delivery in December to a U.S. client of their two adorable twin Siamese cat clones, and with new orders ramping up for genetic preservation for cats and dogs \u2013 it seems word about ViaGen Pets is spreading.\u00a0 The types of questions we get from pet owners exploring options for their beloved pets is also interesting \u2013 but not at all unexpected.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Most want to know how the cloning process works, how long it takes, and what a cloned cat or dog is like.\u00a0 Since there is so much misinformation floating around about cloning and what it really is, and with so much news in the press recently about dog cloning, we get lots of great questions.\u00a0 We gladly spend as much time as needed explaining to our potential clients \u2013 or \u201cpet parents\u201d as we like to call them &#8212; that a cloned pet is simply a genetic twin of the pet, born at a later time.\u00a0\u00a0 We explain that a cloned pet can be expected to share many of the same physical and behavioral traits of the original pet (aka the \u201cdonor\u201d), and that the environment in which the new animal is raised in \u2013 or any animal for that matter &#8212; will also have an influence on their new pet\u2019s behavior.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We provide as much detail about how the process works as the pet owner wants to have and learn.\u00a0 Some want to hear the very technical and scientific overview, others just want to know that animal cloning is a safe and acceptable process \u2013 which it is.\u00a0 Many pet owners call us thinking that animal cloning is some weird science that ViaGen Pets dreamed up recently, and are very surprised to learn that this is far from the case.\u00a0 Animal cloning, particularly related to prized horses and livestock, has been going on for decades, and is an accepted practice around the world.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Some pet owners we speak to aren\u2019t yet sure if cloning their pet is something they want to do, but want to know if there are other things they can do to safely protect and ensure that their beloved cat or dog family member can be cloned at a later date.\u00a0 The answer to this frequent question is a resounding \u201cyes\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0 We tell them how easy and fast it is to do a genetic preservation (GP) of their pet\u2019s DNA, which is the mandatory first step toward cloning at any time in the future.\u00a0 This important step is easy insurance in the event their pet becomes gravely and unexpectedly ill, has an accident and dies, or ages and passes away naturally.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One other question we are asked often, and which is an important one, is about confidentiality.\u00a0 We understand the sensitivities surrounding the consideration of pet genetic preservation and cloning and the vast importance of keeping things confidential.\u00a0 As with many businesses, the relationships we hold dear with our clients are based upon trust and confidence.\u00a0\u00a0 We have always delivered the highest levels of client experience in this way, and will always continue to do so.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s been exciting to be receiving so many recent inquiries from loving pet owners around the world about our expansion into pet genetic preservation and cloning.
