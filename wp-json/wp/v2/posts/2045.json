The tissue biopsy is the critical first step whether you want to simply preserve your pet\u2019s genetics, or clone your special animal. We recommend that a tissue biopsy be done while your pet is alive and healthy. The biggest reason for this is that you will have the option to re-submit samples if the culture is not successful, which happens from time to time. If you wait to take a skin biopsy until your pet has passed away, and if the cell culture is not successful, it\u2019s impossible to secure another skin biopsy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201cWill my cloned pet look the same as the original, and will it have the same personality?\u201d<\/strong> \u2013 Your cloned puppy or kitten will have the same coloring as the original, but the markings may not be in the same location. For example, if your dog is white and has a brown patch around his right eye, then your cloned puppy will be white but that brown patch could be located on the left eye. An exception to this is calico cats, with more information about them <span style=\"color: #b30e0e;\"><a style=\"color: #b30e0e;\" href=\"http:\/\/mentalfloss.com\/article\/66825\/why-are-calico-cats-almost-always-female-and-always-look-different\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201cWhat happens if more than one kitten or puppy is born?\u201d<\/strong> \u2013 Our contract states that if more than one cloned kitten or puppy is born in the litter you have the option of welcoming each of them into your home at no extra charge. If you are happy with just one, then we place any additional animals from the litter into a loving forever home.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201cMy pet is sick with or has had (<u>ex: cancer<\/u>), does that mean the clone will have it as well?\u201d. <\/strong>The simplified answer is this: if your pet has a genetics-rooted condition, and since a clone of your pet carries the identical genetic make-up as the original, then the cloned animal will likely carry the same condition. However, since many pet health conditions develop as a result of a combination of genetics <em>and<\/em> the environment, it\u2019s difficult to be conclusive. We encourage you to consult your veterinarian to gain a deeper perspective on your pet\u2019s specific condition.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<strong>What is the cost of cloning my dog or cat?\u201d<\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0ViaGen Pets charges $50,000 for cat cloning and $50,000 for dogs. The cost does not differ based on the breed or size of your dog or cat. Payment for pet cloning is made in two installments; we ask for a 50% down payment at the time you sign your pet cloning contract, and collect the balance when you take delivery of your new kitten or puppy \u2013 which happens between 8 \u2013 12 weeks after birth.\u00a0 If you are undecided whether to proceed with cloning immediately, but don\u2019t want to miss the opportunity later, that\u2019s no problem. We recommend you do a genetic preservation\u00a0now to preserve your pet\u2019s cells. Once a genetic preservation is successful, those cells can be stored indefinitely.\u00a0 So whether you decide to move on to cloning at a later date, or just want the peace of mind knowing your pet\u2019s DNA has been preserved, genetic preservation is available for a cat or dog for $1,600.<\/p>\n<p>We are here to answer any questions you have, and are just a phone call away!\u00a0 \u00a0Feel free to contact us at 888-876-6104.
