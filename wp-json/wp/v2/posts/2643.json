century entertainment was this lovable dog who actually did have a marking that made a ring almost completely around his eye.\u00a0 His original name was Pal the Wonder Dog and though the television series Our Gang had a number of dogs who played Pete, the original was a Pit Bull Terrier who joined the show in 1927 and stayed with the cast until his death in 1930.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Smoky, the

through air\/sea rescue and reconnaissance missions, 12 combat missions, 150 air raids, and a typhoon in Japan.\u00a0 Her most famous accomplishment was running a telegraph wire 70 feet through a small pipe thereby removing the need to have ground crewmen, construction crews, and reconnaissance planes (for air support) work for days to dig a trench for the wire while under enemy fire.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rin Tin Tin <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2654\" src=\"https:\/\/viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/rin-tin-tin.jpg\"

\/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Since I\u2019ve mentioned Reveille it is only fair to include a lesser known mascot from rival school the University of Texas.\u00a0 Though they are represented by a longhorn now, when the first athletic director arrived at the school he brought with him a dog later dubbed Pig.\u00a0 Pig accompanied his owner to work every day and made the rounds of campus and became a popular and well-known fixture there until his death.\u00a0 He was laid to rest on campus after a procession down Guadalupe Street and a eulogy by the Dean of the College of Engineering attended by over 1000 students.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lord Byron&#8217;s dog Boatswain <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The poet Lord Byron had a beloved Newfoundland who died of Rabies at the age of 5 and inspired Byron to write the poem \u201cEpitaph to a Dog\u201d which contained the following moving lines:<\/p>\n<p>But the poor Dog, in life the firmest friend,<br \/>\nThe first to welcome, foremost to defend,<br \/>\nWhose honest heart is still his Master\u2019s own,<br \/>\nWho labours, fights, lives, breathes for him alone.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hachiko <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full

remembered for the remarkable loyalty he displayed for his deceased owner.\u00a0 While his owner was alive, Hachiko would meet him each day when he got off the train after his commute from work.\u00a0 Though his owner passed away at work one day and never returned, Hachiko continued to travel to the train station and wait for him for the next nine years, nine months, and fifteen days until his own death in 1935.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Seaman &#8211; Dog of the Lewis and Clark Expedition <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2657\"

again just due to his sheer perseverance.\u00a0 According to his journals, Captain Lewis purchased Seaman for $20 just before setting out on his famous expedition with William Clark.\u00a0 The dog
