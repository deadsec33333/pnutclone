At the same time, Trans Ova Genetics welcomed the birth of their first cloned heifer in 1998 and began offering the service to their bovine clients several years later.\u00a0 The two companies operated independently until 2007, when they joined forces to create Bovance, a joint venture that provided bovine cloning services to clients in the U.S., while ViaGen continued to provide services to other livestock species, including pigs and horses.\u00a0 In 2012, Trans Ova Genetics purchased ViaGen.\u00a0 In 2014, Trans Ova Genetics and ViaGen were purchased by Intrexon, a publicly traded synthetic biology company, which brought many new opportunities to the business.<\/p>\n<p>Along the way, there were a lot of firsts \u2013 the first calf, the first foal, the first piglet, the first fawn, etc.\u00a0 The first endangered species, gestated in a cross species was also born.\u00a0 Two endangered species have been propagated using this technology 1) a Gaur and 2) a Banteng.\u00a0 The cloning of the Gaur landed the technology a spot on the cover of Time Magazine. ViaGen also provides programs for cloned embryos that produce transgenic animals for biomedical purposes.<\/p>\n<p>2017 is the 15<sup>th<\/sup> anniversary year for ViaGen.\u00a0 Today, ViaGen continues to offer Genetic Preservation services to clients who own non-primate mammals and the ViaGen lab has preserved literally thousands of cell lines from multiple species of animals, including rare and endangered species.\u00a0 In 2016, they celebrated the addition of ViaGen Pets, and produced their first cloned puppy and kitten for their delighted pet clients.\u00a0 ViaGen Pets has been a key development for the company in the past year, with incredible acceptance from pet owners around the world. The dog and cat clients that utilize those services, are very grateful for the opportunity to clone their beloved pet. ViaGen also celebrated the addition of a small ruminant division and have produced both cloned lambs and kids for those happy clients.\u00a0 We asked Blake Russell, President of ViaGen, what he thinks their biggest success has been to date.\u00a0 \u201cWithout a doubt, I think we have been most successful at assembling a world class team of scientists, and the team that supports this technology through customer service, sales and marketing, accounting and animal care. We are very fortunate to have the \u201cbest in the world\u201d at all levels of our business, but more importantly, they are all passionate about making dreams come true for our clients.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So what does the future hold for ViaGen?\u00a0 Many new technologies are being forged now that will revolutionize animal breeding as we know it, and you can bet that ViaGen will be a key player in the utilization of these technologies.\u00a0 We encourage you to continue to follow ViaGen on social media to learn more about these fascinating opportunities through their website, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\">www.viagenpets.com<\/a>, or you can follow ViaGen Pets on Facebook and Instagram.\u00a0 If you are interested in learning more about how ViaGen fulfill the need to preserve the DNA on your beloved pet, rockstar cow, or award winning pig today, simply call 1-888-8ViaGen.<\/p>\n<p>Congratulations to ViaGen on their 15<sup>th<\/sup> year anniversary\u2026..we can\u2019t wait to see what you do in the next 15 years!<\/p>\n<p>-Diane<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In 1996, the world met a miracle named Dolly.\u00a0 The ewe (lady sheep) was born at the Roslin Institute in Scotland.\u00a0 Dolly was unique in that she was the first cloned mammal produced from an adult cell.\u00a0 In the subsequent 20 years since Dolly\u2019s birth, ViaGen and Trans Ova Genetics have been part of the [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2783,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-2782","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v24.7 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Author Archives: A Historical Look at ViaGen and their Fascinating Science<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Many new technologies are being forged now that will revolutionize animal breeding.
