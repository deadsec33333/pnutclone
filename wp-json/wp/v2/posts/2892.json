Just like the babies that are produced in cattle embryo transfer, cloned pets spend a very short period of time, as embryos, in a specially designed petri dish. \u00a0Very quickly, the embryos are transferred into surrogate mothers or recipients for gestation or pregnancy.\u00a0 And after a normal gestation period, for their species or breed, the cloned puppy or kitten is born and they begin to do the things all puppies and kittens do \u2013 drink, sleep, play, drink, sleep, play\u2026..<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\u201cCloned animals have short lifespans, and are born as old animals\u201d.\n<ul>\n<li>Cloned animals, including pets, share very similar lifespans with their non-cloned peers.\u00a0 There was some speculation that cloned animals would be born \u201cold\u201d but due to cell reprogramming, your cloned pet will be born as a newborn puppy or kitten.\u00a0 You can expect them to live a normal lifespan.\u00a0 That being said, cloned animals are not immortal, they will die someday, from the same things that all pets die from.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\u201cCloned animals are robots\u201d.\n<ul>\n<li>Cloned animals, including pets, are not robots, made of metal and circuitry.\u00a0 They are flesh and blood animals, just like your other pets, and need to be loved, nurtured and cared for by you.\u00a0 In return, they will give you the unconditional love that comes through the pet \u2013 human bond.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\u201cCloned animals will be born with the same disease the original pet died from.\u201d\n<ul>\n<li>If a disease is acquired by the original animal after the birth event, the cloned puppy or kitten will not exhibit the disease at birth.\u00a0 Basically cloning is a \u201cdo over\u201d for those events that occur after birth, like castration or disease acquisition.\u00a0 (For example, a castrated male will be born as an intact cloned male). \u00a0Many diseases are caused by environmental influences.\u00a0 If the same environmental influences are present during the life of the pet, they may or may not develop the same disease later in life.<\/li>\n<li>If the disease is due to a genetic defect, then yes, a cloned animal will have that same genetic defect since they are a genetic match to the original animal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\u201cCloned animals are only for the rich and famous\u201d.\n<ul>\n<li>Not true.\u00a0 A Genetic Preservation is only $1600 and an Express Tissue Bank is a very affordable $500, making preservation of your pet within your reach.\u00a0 Cloning may be a decision that you make at a later point, but if you have a pet you love now, and want to have the ability to consider this option, simply call ViaGen Pets at 1-888-876-6104 to learn more about preserving the DNA on that beloved pet today.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0\u201cCloned animals do not look and act the same as the original\u201d.\n<ul>\n<li>Your cloned pet is a genetic twin to the original dog or cat.\u00a0 They will be the same sex, the same color and may have the same mannerisms as the original but that does not mean they will be an \u201cexact\u201d replica.\u00a0 For example, the spot pattern on a cloned animal, although very similar, may vary due to migration of the melanoblasts that cause coat color.\u00a0 You will also find this in identical twins that are not cloned animals.\u00a0 If the original dog was black and white spotted, the color of the cloned puppy will be black and white spotted but the spot pattern may vary.\u00a0 The personality of your cloned puppy or kitten is determined by genetics x environment.\u00a0 We will give you a genetic match but we cannot mimic the environment and experiences the first puppy or kitten had.\u00a0 The environment that the cloned puppy or kitten are nurtured in will play a large role in the personality of that pet.\u00a0 That being said, owners of cloned animals will say that they exhibit many of the mannerisms of the original animal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\u201cWhat about the surrogates?\u201d.\n<ul>\n<li>The surrogate, or recipient mothers, are provided the best of care.\u00a0 A very high quality diet and loving care from trained professionals is a must.\u00a0 The dogs are kept inside a secured and safe facility where they are housed in social groups with toys and daily interaction with people who play with them, pet them and groom them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>For more information on ViaGen Pets, simply contact 1-888-876-6104 or view our website at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\">www.viagenpets.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>-Diane, Melain &amp; Codi<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The misconceptions about pet cloning, are very similar , so let\u2019s talk about the top 8 \u00a0questions we are asked and provide you with some facts that will help answer those questions. \u00a0\u201cCloning is a new science\u201d.
