So how much of the \u201cpersonality\u201d of a puppy, or kitten, or calf is innate and how much is environmental?\u00a0 The answer is that we simply don\u2019t know.\u00a0 It does appear that genetic traits like excellent fertility, milk production, marbling, etc. are seen in the cloned animals as well, but when it comes to personality the story is still unfolding. Allow me to share a few stories and you can be the judge.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Today, I was walking through the cloned calves and I noticed that three cloned calves, all from the same genetic donor, were playing with their tongues or rolling them as they lounged in the cool shade of the trees in the pasture. It appeared to be an entertaining past time for them, and I wondered \u201cDid their genetic donor do this as well?\u201d\u00a0 After a quick call I learned that indeed, the genetic donor did like to play with her tongue, just like the cloned calves were doing today.\u00a0 Now mind you, they have not yet met each other, but apparently this characteristic is innate and since they all have the same genotype, they are all predisposed to roll their tongue.<\/li>\n<li>We also talked to a delightful pet client that has a toy poodle. She now has two cloned identical twins as well as the original poodle in the same house. \u201cViaGen made the cloning process simply amazing. My expectations were many and ViaGen didn&#8217;t disappoint! The puppies turned out exactly as I was hoping for. They are identical, goofy, loving, healthy and full of life. The cloned puppies BJ and Ditto are identical. They look so much alike I have to put dye at the end of one tail to tell them apart or have one cut a little shorter than the other. It&#8217;s unbelievable how much they look alike.\u201d\u00a0 The original poodle loves to watch TV so she was curious if the genetic twins would do the same. \u201cOne likes TV and the other doesn&#8217;t care. One is lazy and the other is always on the run. One is scared of a leaf in the yard while the other is fearless. One is a bully and the other is more submissive. Buhner (the original dog) loves BJ and Ditto and is very protective of them. He is more playful now because of them and life couldn&#8217;t be better!\u201d Time will tell whether these puppies become more like the original animal the longer they are exposed to his leadership, and the nurturing environment of this home. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3213\" src=\"https:\/\/viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Buhner-puppies-at-home-296x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"296\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Buhner-puppies-at-home-296x300.jpg 296w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Buhner-puppies-at-home-1009x1024.jpg 1009w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Buhner-puppies-at-home-768x779.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Buhner-puppies-at-home-300x304.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Buhner-puppies-at-home-100x100.jpg 100w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Buhner-puppies-at-home-71x71.jpg 71w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Buhner-puppies-at-home.jpg 1242w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px\" \/><\/li>\n<li>We delivered two little longhorn calves to a client in Texas that had cloned his favorite longhorn male. The original animal is very tame and comes to their house on the ranch for regular grooming.\u00a0 He likes to be brushed.\u00a0 And he likes treats! As the two cloned calves were growing up in Iowa, we learned they too, were very tame and really liked their backs rubbed.\u00a0 After delivery this week, the client introduced the calves to their \u201cmentor\u201d.\u00a0 They immediately took to each other and now run the range together.\u00a0 And yes\u2026.they all come to the ranch house for their daily brushing! One of the clones promptly walked up the steps to the house and stood on their porch, waiting for his treat of cubes.\u00a0 And then he walked right down the steps, like he had done it every day of his life. One interesting feature about these calves is that they all \u201ctear up\u201d when the rancher feeds them the range cubes by hand.\u00a0 Sounds to me like they really love their rancher, or maybe it\u2019s the treats, or maybe both!\n<p><div id=\"attachment_3211\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3211\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-3211\" src=\"https:\/\/viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/20170709_153217-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/20170709_153217-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/20170709_153217-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/20170709_153217-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/20170709_153217-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/20170709_153217-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-3211\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cloned calf coming down the ranch house steps after going up for treats.<\/p><\/div><\/li>\n<li>A cat client was willing to share her story with us as well. \u201cWaiting for Blue to return home as a new kitten was the hardest part.\u00a0 At the time, it felt like an eternity.\u00a0 But once he was back, it was as if all the waiting was only five minutes.\u00a0 In other words, it felt like I had simply boarded him and now he was back home.\u00a0 On every possible level, the kitten seems like my original cat.\u00a0 But blue is a kitten now.\u00a0 I remember one day, after he\u2019d been home about 2 months, I looked up from my work and Blue did something that was so clearly Blue, that spontaneously I burst out laughing.\u00a0 Kitten Blue rolled his \u201cR\u2019s\u201d just like Blue the original!\u201d \u201cAt that moment, I had no doubt that Blue was back.\u00a0 Now I hardly think about how he\u2019s a clone\u2026.he\u2019s Blue!\u201d\n<p><div id=\"attachment_3209\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3209\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-3209\" src=\"https:\/\/viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Blue--300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Blue--300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Blue--1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Blue--150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Blue--768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Blue--1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Blue--2048x2048.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Blue--71x71.jpg 71w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Blue--100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-3209\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Left &#8211;
