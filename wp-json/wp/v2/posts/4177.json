We embrace every pet with the same love and dedication as the one before them. And they love us right back. But every once-in-awhile, we form an incredible bond with one of our pets. One that\u2019s unbreakable. A bond so strong that you rearrange your life for them.<\/p>\n<p>I call these remarkable pets. They get the two-way camera installed so you can video chat with them in the middle of the day. They fill up our friends&#8217; social media feeds with more pictures than they post of their kids! When you\u2019re having a bad day, they sense it and can make you feel better just by licking your face or laying on top of you. They want to spend every minute with you! Bottom line, they become family and extensions of ourselves. I\u2019ve been blessed to have one of those pets in my life, and chances are so have you if you are reading this!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4178\" src=\"https:\/\/viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/a1-246x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"246\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/a1-246x300.jpg 246w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/a1-841x1024.jpg 841w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/a1-768x935.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/a1-300x365.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/a1.jpg 1040w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 246px) 100vw, 246px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, like all pets, they don\u2019t live forever. The pain of losing a remarkable pet is a heartbreaking, gut-wrenching pain. I\u2019ve experienced it myself, and it felt like the end of the world. I\u2019m not exaggerating either, my life felt completely shattered. It\u2019s hard enough to go through that type of pain, but it\u2019s even harder when people don\u2019t know how to support you. Society knows how hard it is to lose a special person, so they offer you empathy, understanding, and time to heal. However, when we lose a remarkable pet, the common response is a text message or Facebook comment, which are nice but fall short of the compassion you get when a special person dies.<\/p>\n<p>Think about it though.<\/p>\n<p>We see these animals every day and they\u2019re constantly enriching our lives. Most of us get our pets when they are months old, and watch them grow up from a baby to an adult. These pets know us as well as anyone&#8230;better in some cases (remember they see things that no one else sees!). We open our hearts and homes to these amazing animals and make them part of our families. They return that generosity with absolute unconditional love. I once heard a joke saying, \u201cLock your wife and dog up in a trunk and come back in 30 minutes and see which one is still happy to see you!\u201d You can be a millionaire living in a mansion or living in poverty and your animal will love you the absolute same. They are such an incredible force in our life, so when they\u2019re gone, we want to do something special for them and find a way to continue to hold them close.<\/p>\n<p>Let me tell you my story.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4179\" src=\"https:\/\/viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/11001812_10205132796816198_7743663796053068102_n-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/11001812_10205132796816198_7743663796053068102_n-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/11001812_10205132796816198_7743663796053068102_n-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/11001812_10205132796816198_7743663796053068102_n-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/11001812_10205132796816198_7743663796053068102_n-100x100.jpg 100w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/11001812_10205132796816198_7743663796053068102_n-71x71.jpg 71w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/11001812_10205132796816198_7743663796053068102_n.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A few years ago, I lost my Boston Terrier, Miss Piggy. She was my ride or die, my partner in crime, and the most impactful pet I\u2019ve ever had. She was much more than a pet to me, she was my best friend, and went everywhere with me including work.<\/p>\n<p>Miss Piggy had a serious heart murmur that was detected in a standard check-up. My vet, Dr. Jennifer Martinson (the best vet I\u2019ve ever had), told me that it was hard to pinpoint how long she\u2019d live, but she\u2019s never seen an animal live more than 10-12 months from the stage she was at. I completely lost it, I was crushed, I cried in my car for 30 minutes and just held her tight. I was committed to making her as comfortable as possible and doing whatever I needed to. At this time I was working for a startup at a reduced salary and didn\u2019t even have health insurance. The medication to keep Miss Piggy comfortable and treat the illness was about $300 a month. I didn\u2019t have disposable income at the time, but I made it work because she was everything to me.<\/p>\n<p>She required checkups every month, and two months later, Dr. Martinson found a tumor unrelated to the heart issue and estimated she had two weeks to live. This might sound dramatic, but my life might as well have been over at that moment because she was so special to me. There was an option to try to surgically remove the tumor, but there was a risk of her not surviving the surgery due to the heart issue. My vet and I both decided against putting her through that. I just hoped for the best and wanted to spend every minute with her.<\/p>\n<p>My boss let me work remotely so I could stay home with her and even came to my house for meetings. He knew what she meant to me. I didn\u2019t go out with friends, I left the house only to go to the grocery store and to get her medication refills.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve said multiple times how special Piggy was, but I haven\u2019t mentioned how much of a fighter she was. Piggy ended up living past two weeks, past four weeks, past six months, past 12 months after being given two weeks to live. She went 15 months from being diagnosed with the heart murmur when Dr. Martinson had previously said she\u2019d never seen an animal go longer than 12 months. She fought and fought until the end.<\/p>\n<p>When it was finally her time to go, having to make the decision to put her down was the toughest thing I\u2019ve gone through in my adult life. You\u2019d think I\u2019d be prepared for her passing after going through emotional devastation for 15 months, but when you lose a family member like Piggy, you\u2019re never prepared and the pain is deep. I wanted to honor her in the best way I could and I ended up having her cremated and having her put in a small burgundy wood box along with an engraved nameplate, a paw print and a lock of her fur. I\u2019ve since made a memory box to celebrate her life. Piggy was a once in a lifetime pet and I\u2019m so lucky that she was in my life.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4180\" src=\"https:\/\/viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/b-1-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/b-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/b-1-300x400.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.viagenpets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/b-1.jpg 720w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There are lots of things that people do to honor their pet&#8217;s memory. From urns to memory boxes, to statuettes, to taxidermy. These are all fine ways to honor your pet, but I\u2019ve never been able to shake the feeling that I wish I could do more. I wanted to do something truly special for her.<\/p>\n<p>Lucky for us, it\u2019s 2018, and innovation is finally happening in the memorial space. We\u2019re starting to see new, and exciting options to keep our pets spirits alive.<\/p>\n<p>Cloning your special family member with ViaGen gives you the chance to make new memories with an identical twin. I still can\u2019t believe this is possible &#8211; it\u2019s truly miraculous. Getting to see your remarkable pet grow up all over again is beyond amazing. It gives me goosebumps when I think about the people getting to experience that. Their spirit lives on through this miracle!<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, I was unaware of this option so I\u2019ll never be able to have another Miss Piggy.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eterneva.com\/\">Guest Post by: Jacob<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We love our pets &#8211; we do anything and everything for them.
